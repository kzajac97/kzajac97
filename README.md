### Krzysztof Zając

Hi, I'm Krzysztof, I like everything related to machine learning and neural networks, from research to deployment.

### Me

I currently work at [Opera Software](https://www.opera.com/) as AI Engineer, working on [Opera Neon](https://www.operaneon.com/) 
project and at Wrocław University of Science and Technology as a part of cyber-physical-systems-group, where I work on
research about modelling dynamical systems with neural networks and teaching machine learning courses.
