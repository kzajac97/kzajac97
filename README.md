I like training all kinds of neural networks. <br>

Some things I'm working on:
* [frequency neural networks](https://github.com/kzajac97/frequency-neural-networks) - scientific work on developing neural operators for nonlinear dynamical system identification using Fourier transform
* [master thesis](https://github.com/kzajac97/master-thesis)  - My master thesis

Some things I've worked in the past:
* [Hardfacing neural modelling](https://github.com/kzajac97/hardfacing-neural-modelling) - using shallow neural networks and robust learning approach to constructing models of hardfacing process using experimental data
* [Various time series and generative models](https://github.com/kzajac97/tensorflow-notebooks)

Some university stuff (repo names are often names of the courses):
* [Statistical estimators](https://github.com/kzajac97/MID) - various estimators and basic dynamical system identification
* [Neural style transfer and image generator](https://github.com/kzajac97/AWD)
* [Style transfer in a mobile app](https://github.com/kzajac97/neural-styler)
* [Distributed database with web app](https://github.com/kzajac97/flight_db)
* [Multiobjective evolutional optimization algorithm](https://github.com/kzajac97/SPEA)
* [Discreate optimization algorithms in C++](https://github.com/kzajac97/SPD)
* [Custom RSA implementation for audio files in C++](https://github.com/kzajac97/e-media)
