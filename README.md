I like training all kinds of neural networks. Currently I'm working at [*PeakData AG*](https://www.peakdata.com/) with NLP and data processing and teaching and researchig at *WrocÅ‚aw University of Science and Technology* as a part of [`cyber-physical-systems-group`](https://github.com/cyber-physical-systems-group), where I work on teaching neural networks nonlinear dynamics.<br>

Some things I'm currently working on:
* Libary for developing neural networks for nonlinear dynamics called [`pydentification`](https://github.com/cyber-physical-systems-group/pydentification)
* Recreating transformer architecture on minimal examples for fun @ [`reconstructing-transformer`](https://github.com/kzajac97/reconstructing-transformer)
* Teaching university course about [`machine-vision`](https://github.com/kzajac97/machine-vision), including processing, compression and neural networks

Some things I've worked in the past, which are left here:
* Developing neural networks with Fourier transform for nonlinear system identification, called [`frequency-supported-neural-network`](https://github.com/kzajac97/frequency-supported-neural-networks)
* Using shallow neural networks with robust learning (changing the loss function) to constructing models of hardfacing process using experimental data @ [`hardfacing-neural-modelling`](https://github.com/kzajac97/hardfacing-neural-modelling))
* Using images of metal microstructure to estimate its hardness using fractal dimension computed from the image, [`visual-material-recognition`](https://github.com/kzajac97/visual-material-recognition)
* Numerous time-series experiments with neural networks, including [`tensorflow-notebooks`](https://github.com/kzajac97/tensorflow-notebooks) and [`university courses`](https://github.com/kzajac97/MID)
* Some [`evolutionary-optimization`](https://github.com/kzajac97/evolutionary-algorithms) and [`spea`](https://github.com/kzajac97/SPEA)
* Some generative models and [`neural styling`](https://github.com/kzajac97/AWD) (with minal [mobile-app](`https://github.com/kzajac97/neural-styler`))
