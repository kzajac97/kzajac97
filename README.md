I like training all kinds of neural networks. <br>

Some things I'm working on:
* [Frequency Neural Networks]() - scientific work on developing neural operators for nonlinear dynamical system identification using Fourier transform (soon made public)

Some things I've worked in the past:
* [Hardfacing Neural Modelling](https://github.com/kzajac97/hardfacing-neural-modelling) - using shallow neural networks and robust learning approach to constructing models of hardfacing process using experimental data
* [Visual Material Recognition](https://github.com/kzajac97/visual-material-recognition) - using image of steel microstructure to estimate its hardness using fractal dimensions 
* [Some Experiments](https://github.com/kzajac97/tensorflow-notebooks) - Various time series and generative models

Some university stuff (repo names are often names of the courses):
* [Statistical Estimators](https://github.com/kzajac97/MID) - various estimators and basic dynamical system identification
* [Neural Styler Research](https://github.com/kzajac97/AWD) - Neural style transfer and image generator
* [Neural Styler](https://github.com/kzajac97/neural-styler) - Style transfer in a mobile app
* [FlightDB](https://github.com/kzajac97/flight_db) - Distributed database with web app
* [SPEA](https://github.com/kzajac97/SPEA) - Multiobjective evolutional optimization algorithm based on Pareto principle
* [Discrete Control Theory](https://github.com/kzajac97/SPD) - Discreate optimization algorithms in C++
* [EMedia](https://github.com/kzajac97/e-media) - Custom RSA implementation for audio files in C++
