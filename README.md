I like training all kinds of neural networks. <br>

Some things I'm working on:
* [Dynamical Neural Networks](https://github.com/kzajac97/dynamical-neural-networks) - developing new neural network architectures for nonlinear system identification
* [Reconstructing Transformers](https://github.com/kzajac97/reconstructing-transformer) - recreating transformer architecture on minimal examples
* [Machine Vision Classes](https://github.com/kzajac97/machine-vision) - university course about machine vision, including processing, compression and neural networks 

Some things I've worked in the past:
* [Frequency Supported Neural Networks](https://github.com/kzajac97/frequency-supported-neural-networks) - developing neural networks with Fourier transform for nonlinear system identification
* [Hardfacing Neural Modelling](https://github.com/kzajac97/hardfacing-neural-modelling) - using shallow neural networks and robust learning approach to constructing models of hardfacing process using experimental data
* [Visual Material Recognition](https://github.com/kzajac97/visual-material-recognition) - using image of steel microstructure to estimate its hardness using fractal dimensions 
* [Some Experiments](https://github.com/kzajac97/tensorflow-notebooks) - various time series and generative models
